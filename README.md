* The deck is unlimited in size.
* There are no jokers.
* The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
* The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
* The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.

# How to run
The game is really simple. Essentially we're trying to get as close to 21 as possible and all of the cards which have a Jack, a Queen, or a King count as 10.
As soon as game starts it wil ask if yiu want to play game or not. If yes it wil generate logo, two cards of user, its score and one card of computer. To continue with the third card type y or else n. 

It will compare user cards with Computer's card, whosoever's score is near to 21 will win.
